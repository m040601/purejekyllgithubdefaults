    home.html — The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [More Info.]
    page.html — The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.

Moving your Jekyll site from GitHub Pages to GitLab - BFTSYSTEMS | LTD
Once your repository has been moved to GitLab, nothing will work immediately and no pages will be built. Unlike GitHub, GitLab uses a CI (continuous integration) configuration file to instruct the GitLab site Runners how to build your site. This process is a little more complex than GitHub, but also more flexible. Primarily, this flexibility is what brought me to GitLab for hosting.

To setup the build process, you must create a file named .gitlab-ci.yml in your repository. The contents of this file will direct GitLab how to build your site. The full documentation on this process can be found in the document Hosting on GitLab.com with GitHub Pages. As this site is built using Jekyll, I followed the steps in the document outlining the configuration process specifically for Jekyll.

This is where things get a little interesting. When it comes to building the CI file for Jekyll, the GitLab documentation is somewhat vague, and misses several edge cases

Duplicating a repository - User Documentation



    mac
    windows
    linux

To duplicate a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.

Before you can duplicate a repository and push to your new copy, or mirror, of the repository, you must create the new repository on GitHub.
